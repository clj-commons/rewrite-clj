= Merging rewrite-clj and rewrite-cljs
:toc:
:toclevels: 6

== Introduction
Rewrite-clj v1 is a merge of https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/tree/f515767e4f07f27389ee2885cb459bd87d903887[rewrite-clj v0] and https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-cljs[rewrite-cljs] giving us a one stop rewrite-clj shop for Clojure and ClojureScript developers.

== Goals
1. *Minimize API breakage*.
Within reason, maintain API compatibility with both rewrite-clj v0 and rewrite-cljs.
I'd like rewrite-clj v1 to be an low friction replacement for `rundis/rewrite-cljs` (actually now living at `clj-commons/rewrite-cljs`) and `xsc/rewrite-clj` v0 (now living a clj-commons/rewrite-clj).
2. *Feature parity*.
Rewrite-cljs has lagged behind rewrite-clj v0.
Bring rewrite-cljs up to parity with rewrite-clj v0.
Bring any rewrite-cljs specific features over to rewrite-clj v1.
3. *Preserve type hints*.
I will respect and carry over existing type hinting in rewrite-clj v0 and rewrite-cljs.
I will not, at this time, evaluate if existing type hinting has value.
4. *Improve documentation*.
I think that rewrite-clj v0 documentation is good, but as I dig deeper into using the library and get feedback on Slack, I see places where guidance could be improved.
5. *Document design decisions*.
I'm not sure what form this will take, but I do like projects that include histories of architectural and design decisions.
Perhaps I'll adopt https://github.com/cljdoc/cljdoc/tree/master/doc/adr[ADR ala cljdoc].
For now you can think of this document as I kind of sloppy-mega ADR for my merge work.
6. *Modernize/update test/build*.
Look at what is available today and make a choice.
7. *Define library version scheme*.
Evaluate options, pick one and document.
8. *Find home for this work*.
We have achieved the ideal here.
Rewrite-clj v1 will continue from the same source repo as rewrite-clj v0.
We will also continue to deploy to clojars rewrite-clj/rewrite-clj.

== Strategic Compromises
1. *Favor single code base*.
I will favor a single code base over maintaining  http://rundis.github.io/blog/2015/clojurescript_performance_tuning.html[ClojureScript specific optimizations from rewrite-cljs].
These can be brought in at a later date if needed.
2. *Use generic exceptions*.
This is technically an API breakage, but I will switch to using the Clojure/ClojureScript agnostic `ex-info` for exceptions.
3. *Favor rewrite-clj features when there is overlap*.
I currently only see one feature that overlaps between the two projects.
Rewrite-clj v0 and rewrite-cljs both have positional (row/col) support.
Base positional support in rewrite-clj v0 is full featured and updates with any changes made, so we'll use it instead of rewrite-cljs's more primitive tools reader based positional support.
This technically constitutes an API breakage for rewrite-cljs.
We will, though, carry over rewrite-cljs's higher level positional functions.

== Changes
See link:../../CHANGELOG.adoc[change log].

=== Feature Differences
No ability to read from files when using rewrite-clj v1 from ClojureScript.

== Root namespace of `rewrite-clj`

Both rewrite-clj v0 and rewrite-cljs share the same root namespace of `rewrite-clj`.

We'll happily continue with `rewrite-clj` for rewrite-clj v1 work:

. rewrite-clj v0 was transferred to clj-commons/rewrite-clj
. rewrite-clj v1 will carry on in clj-commons/rewrite-clj
. we'll continue to use the existing rewrite-clj v0 clojars maven coordinates `xsc/rewrite-clj` for rewrite-clj v1

[#rewrite-clj-legacy-libs]
== Projects Using rewrite-clj v0 and/or rewrite-cljs
I've tried to make note of popular/active projects that make use of rewrite-clj v0 and rewrite-cljs.
I've linked where I've explicitly verified a migration to rewrite-clj v1.

See README for up to date list of which libraries directly use so form of rewrite-clj and which ones we are currently link:#canary-testing[canary testing].

[#rewrite-clj-v1-libs]
== Projects Using rewrite-clj v1

See README for up to date list.

[#canary-testing]
== Canary Testing
I'm not sure if canary testing is exactly the right term here.
My goal is to know when changes to rewrite-clj v1 break popular libraries.

This would mean running these libraries' tests against rewrite-clj v1 master.

After some experimentation, my general strategy is to:

. Install rewrite-clj HEAD to the local maven repository under a "canary" version
. For each library we want to test:
.. Grab the a specified release of a project from GitHub via zip download
.. Patch deps to
... Point to rewrite-clj canary release
... Adjust Clojure version if necessary (we are 1.8 and above)
.. Adjust sources as necessary
... Ex. rewrite-cljc -> rewrite-clj namespace
... At the time of the writing only zprint v1.1.1. needed a src code hack to get its tests passing.
It is the only lib that digs into namespaced maps, and things changed a tad here for rewrite-clj v1
.. Run any necessary library test prep steps
.. Run libraries tests (or a subset of them)

== Tooling

=== Build tools
I have moved from leiningen to tools cli and `deps.edn`.
Like everything, this change has pros and cons.
Overall, I like the simplicity and control it brings.
Babashka scripts take the place of lein aliases where I can have the build do exactly what I want it to.

=== Continuous integration
The future of https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] looked a bit tenuous when I started work on rewrite-clj v1.
I initially switched over to https://circleci.com/[CircleCI], but then when GitHub Actions became available decided it was a better fit:

* in addition to Linux, offers macOS and Windows testing in its free tier
* 7gb of RAM satisfies GraalVM's memory hungry `native-image`

=== Testing and linting tools
After looking around, I settled on the following for continuous integration:

. https://github.com/lambdaisland/kaocha[Kaocha] for running Clojure unit tests.
. moved from lein-doo to https://github.com/Olical/cljs-test-runner[cljs-test-runner] (which still uses https://github.com/bensu/doo[doo] under the hood) for running ClojureScript unit tests under node and chrome headless.
I considered Kaocha's cljs support and will reconsider when it matures a bit.
. I fail the build when a lint with https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo[clj-kondo] produces any warnings and/or errors.

During development, I found the following helpful:

. kaocha in watch mode for Clojure
. figwheel main for ClojureScript

== General Decisions

=== Library version scheme
I see plenty of version scheme variations out there these days.
Here are a few examples I find interesting:

[cols="10,40,20,~",options="header"]
|====
|Project
|Scheme
|Example
|Observation

|https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/releases[ClojureScript]
|major.minor.<commit count since major.minor>
|`1.10.520`
|Tracks Clojure version.

|https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo/releases[clj-kondo]
|yyyy-mm-dd-qualifier
|`2019.07.05-alpha`
|Freshness built into version.

|https://github.com/cljdoc/cljdoc[cljdoc]
|major.minor.<commit count>-<short git sha>
|`0.0.1315-c9e9a73`
|The short-sha safeguards against any potential confusion with duplicate commit counts for builds on different machines.

|https://github.com/noprompt/meander[meander]
|meander/<release> 0.0.<commit count>
|`meander/delta` `0.0.137`
|This scheme changes the artifact-id (for example gamma to delta) every time a potentially breaking change is introduced effectively releasing a new product for every breaking change.

|https://github.com/clojure/spec.alpha[spec.alpha]
|unimportant
|unimportant
|The alpha state is burnt into the project name and library namespace.
|====

Rewrite-clj v1 is not a new project.
I feel the version should reflect at least some familiarity with its v0 scheme.

As of this writing the current version of rewrite-clj is `0.6.1`.
I am guessing that the 0 is an unused version element, and we have a `0.major.minor` scheme.

Rewrite-clj v1 is going to switch to a `major.minor.<commit count>-<qualifier>` scheme. +
Our first version will be `1.0.451-alpha` where `451` is just a wild guess right now.

An small awkwardness with this scheme is the change log.
The change log should be part of the release but it does reference a git commit count.
This will be addressed by automatically updating the change log doc with the release version as part of the release process.

=== Release Strategy

We'll opt not to make SNAPSHOT releases and assume the community is good with testing pre-releases via GitHub coordinates.
We can adapt if there is a real need for SNAPSHOT releases.

We'll keep a CHANGELOG.adoc carried on from rewrite-clj v0's CHANGES.md.

Release cadence will be as needed.
I don't want us to feel precious about releases.
If there is a benefit to cutting a new release with a small change or fix, even just to docs, we'll go ahead and do it.


=== Source directory layout
When I first started to experiment with a cljc version of rewrite-clj, my directory layout looked like:

----
src/
  clj/
    rewrite-clj/
  cljs/
    rewrite-clj/
  cljc/
    rewrite-clj/
test/
  clj/
    rewrite-clj/
  cljs/
    rewrite-clj/
  cljc/
    rewrite-clj/
----

After a certain amount of work, I realized the majority of the code was cljc so opted for the much simpler:

----
src/
  rewrite-clj/
test/
  rewrite-clj/
----

===  GraalVM Support

Some command line tools written in Clojure are using Graal to compile to native executables for fast startup times.

Others have done the work to test that rewrite-clj v0 can be compiled with Graal.
There is benefit to the community to test that rewrite-clj v1 can also be compiled to native code with Graal.

Noticing that there were differing approaches Graalifying Clojure, none of them centrally documented, @borkdude and I created https://github.com/lread/clj-graal-docs[clj-graal-docs] to develop and share scripts and tips.

My goal is to run the rewrite-clj v1 test suite from a GraalVM native image to give some confidence that rewrite-clj v1 works after compiled with Graal.

==== Technical Issues

. Windows tooling requirements.
Setup for running GraalVM JDK8 on Windows relies on old Microsoft tooling making setup challenging.
. RAM requirements.
GraalVM's `native-image` which creates the target executable, can consume a significant amount of RAM.

==== Windows Tooling Requirements
I've decided that, for now, figuring out how to setup the proper tooling for Windows for GraalVM JDK8 is not worth my effort.
We'll continue to test on Windows but only for GraalVM JDK11.

==== Ram Requirements
I spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out how to overcome the RAM limitations of free tiers of continuous integration services.
Drone Cloud is the most generous with 64gb of RAM available but only supports Linux.
CircleCI offers 3.5gb of RAM and is also Linux only in its free tier.
GitHub Actions, offers 7gb of RAM and offers macOS, Linux and Windows.

I seriously explored two approaches:

. natively compile tests and library
. interpret tests via sci over natively compile library

If I had applied https://github.com/lread/clj-graal-docs#native-image-compilation-time[Clojure direct linking] earlier in my tests, I might have stopped at the first approach.
For me, direct linking made approach 1 viable.

For now, I am testing using both approaches.
Overviews can be found at https://github.com/lread/clj-graal-docs/blob/master/doc/testing-strategies.md[clj-graal-doc's testing strategies page].

== Questionable Decisions

=== Allowing garden style keywords

Borkdude is kind enough to ping me when there are issues with the internally forked version of rewrite-clj he uses for clj-kondo.
It turns out that clojure.tools.reader.edn does not parse https://github.com/noprompt/garden[garden-style] keywords such as `:&::before`.
The reader sees a double colon as illegal if it is anywhere in the keyword.
Borkdude overcame this limitation by allowing a keyword to contain embedded double colons via a customized version of ``clojure.tools.reader.edn``'s `read-keyword` function.

I transcribed his work to rewrite-clj v1.

The maintenance cost to hacking a 3rd party lib is that upgrades will have to be carefully tracked.
That said, we do have a good suite of tests that should uncover any issues.

=== Not allowing symbols with multiple slashes

While Clojure reads `'org/clojure/math.numeric-tower`, `clojure.tools.reader.edn` barfs on this and therefore rewrite-clj does as well.

It has been documented as illegal for a symbol to have more than one `/`.

I have opted to not, at this time, adapt rewrite-clj v1 to allow parsing of this illegal syntax.
This might seem a bit hypocritical because I did, some time ago, innocently https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo/issues/378[raise an issue on clj-kondo for this].

== Clojure/ClojureScript Issues

=== ClojureScript namespace clashes
ClojureScript uses Google Closure under the hood.
Because of the way Google Closure handles namespaces, some namespaces that work fine on Clojure clash under ClojureScript.
Some rewrite-clj v0 namespaces clash for ClojureScript, for example:

* `rewrite-clj.zip/find`
* `rewrite-clj.zip.find`

The original rewrite-cljs author worked around this problem by renaming namespaces to avoid the clashes.

|===

None of these namespaces are part of public APIs, but because I see a lot of code that uses these internal namespaces, I decided to preserve the existing rewrite-clj v0 and rewrite-cljs naming for rewrite-clj v1.

=== Clojure/ClojureScript Interop

* Where I felt I could get away with it, I localized Clojure/ClojureScript differences in the new `rewrite-clj.interop` namespace.
* Although technically an API breakage, I made a choice to switch all rewrite-clj v0 thrown exceptions to the Clojure/ClojureScript compatible ex-info for rewrite-clj v1.
* Some notes on differences between Clojure and ClojureScript
** throws and catches, if not using ex-info are different
** namespace requires cannot use shorthand syntax in cljs
** macros must (sometimes) be included differently
** IMetaData and other base types differ (this comes into play for us in coercion support)
** format not part of cljs standard lib
** no Character in cljs
** no ratios in cljs
** testing for NaN is different
** different max numerics

== Rewrite-clj/cljs Analysis

=== What is the public API?
rewrite-clj v0 purposefully only generated documentation for specific namespaces.
It is reasonable to assume that these namespaces represent the public API:

* `rewrite-clj.parse`
* `rewrite-clj.node`
* `rewrite-clj.zip`

I am not sure why `rewrite-clj.custom-zipper` is included in the documented public API, because its functionality is exposed through `rewrite-clj.zip`, I expect this was perhaps an oversight, but might be wrong.

Because what is public versus what is private was not stressed strongly in the rewrite-clj v0 README, I frequently see private APIs used in code.
For this reason, I've worked, within reason, not to break what I understand to be private APIs.

=== S-expressions
rewrite-clj allows parsed Clojure/ClojureScript/EDN to be converted back and forth to s-expressions.
Example from a REPL session:

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[rewrite-clj.zip :as z])

(def zipper (z/of-string "[1 2 3]"))  ;; <1>
(pr zipper)
=stdout=> [<vector: [1 2 3]> {:l [], :pnodes [<forms: [1 2 3]>], :ppath nil, :r nil}]

(def s (z/sexpr zipper)) ;; <2>
s
=> [1 2 3]

(require '[rewrite-clj.node :as n])
(pr (n/coerce s)) ;; <3>
=stdout=> <vector: [1 2 3]>
----
<1> parse string to rewrite-clj nodes and create zipper
<2> convert rewrite-clj node at current location in zipper to s-expression
<3> convert s-expression to rewrite-clj node

While I expect this can be quite convenient, it does come with caveats:

1. What happens when we try to `sexpr` Clojure specific features from ClojureScript?
For example, ratios are available in Clojure but not ClojureScript.
2. If you try to `sexpr` something that cannot be converted into an s-expression an exception will be thrown.

My guidance is use `sexpr` in only in specific cases, where you know ahead of time what you are parsing.
General blind use of `sexpr` is not recommended.

For rewrite-clj v1 itself, I have removed internal problematic uses of `sepxr` and documented some of its nuances.

=== Which reader?
Rewrite-clj makes use of Clojure's reader.
There are a few choices though:

1. `clojure.tools.reader`
2. `clojure.tools.reader.edn`
3. `clojure.reader`
4. `clojure/reader-string`

As I understand it, `clojure.tools.reader.edn` is the safest choice and rewrite-clj v1 uses it in all cases.

=== Potemkin import-vars
Rewrite-clj v0 makes use of a slightly modified version of https://github.com/ztellman/potemkin#import-vars[Potemkin import-vars].
The intent of import-vars is to make it easy to expose a public API from a set of internal namespaces.

When I first reviewed its usage in rewrite-clj, I found import-vars to be quite elegant.
I have since learned that there is quite a bit of strong opinion in the Clojure community surrounding import-vars.
Not all of it is rosy.

Also, there is no ClojureScript version of import-vars.

==== What I started with
That said, I decided, in the beginning, to honor the original rewrite-clj codebase and carry on with it.
To be honest, this gave me the (the apparently too tempting to resist) opportunity to learn how to write a version of import-vars for ClojureScript.

This led me to discover that while cljdoc did cope fine with import-vars trickery for Clojure code, it did not have any support for it for ClojureScript code.
I made the necessary changes to cljdoc's fork of codox and subsequently cljdoc-analyzer.

I also extended import-vars to rewrite-clj's purposes by adding a facility to rename imported vars and adapt docstrings.

All was not rainbows and unicorns, after yet another issue with some Clojure tooling, I decided to drop import-vars.

==== What I ended up with
I still like the concept of import-vars.
It automatically exposes an API and helps me to avoid silly human errors that would occur should I do this manually for rewrite-clj's wide APIs.

The issues with potemkin import-vars happen because vars are imported at load-time.
I have moved to handling import-vars at build time.
A build step reads reads an import-vars definition and generates appropriate source.
This moves the burden from rewrite-clj users to rewrite-clj developers, which seems appropriate.

First stab:

* Stick with an import-vars-ish syntax.
Maybe a clj-kondo-ish style syntax `#_{:import-vars/import {:from [[my.ns1 var1 var2 var3] [my.ns2 var4 var5])}}`.
Perhaps we can tease out a tool someday that is generally useful.
* Was thinking of having the build step update source in place, but @borkdude shared an idea of using templates.
Options:

** Maybe have `src/rewrite_clj.zip.template.cljc` that generates/overwrites `src/rewrite_clj/zip.cljc`.
** Or a sister dir structure `template/rewrite_clj/zip.cljc` -> `src/rewrite_clj/zip.cljc`.
I'll start with this, it:
*** keeps templates separate from source.
Not great for locality, but makes excluding them from release easier.
*** keeps the ns name the same for template and target.

Loses from moving to build-time solution:

. When you click on view source on cljdoc you go to the implementation and see the code.
Now you'll be directed to the delegator.
This won't be bothersome from an IDE, most will like it better, you'll be able to flit from delegator to the implementation easily, but a loss from cljdoc.
. An extra build step is required.
This moves the burden from the user to the developer.
I'm ok with this.
. Potentially an extra call.
Will this even register as a performance hit?

Current import-vars usage.
I don't always use import-vars to expose a public API, I sometimes use it internally to avoid human error.
For example `rewrite-clj.node.string` imports from `rewrite-clj.node.stringz`; the 2 namespaces exist due to API namespace collision issues in cljs.

So what would be a good name for the build step?
Maybe `apply-import-vars gen-code`?

I think we'd also want something to read-only verify that the template generated clj is different than the target.
We can fail CI build if this is true.
Maybe `apply-import-vars check`?

How will we find templates?
We'll start with storing all templates under `./template`

How will we choose target for templates?
We'll start `./src` using, otherwise using same template filename.
Extension will match template (clj vs cljc for us).

Ok, so what code should we be generating?
We want to definitely bring over the docstring (sometimes altered).
We'll have the import definition specify `:added` and `:deprecated` metadata.
(Original version had this metadata specified on internal source var, cljs compiler warned about calls to internal deprecated fns from public API, which was not nice for folks using rewrite-clj under cljs).
For the var itself we have choices.

. We could simply point to the source var.
This is effectively what we do with current import-vars at load-time.
. We could generate a delegating fn matching the source arities.
This would probably be more familiar to folks, and many static analysis tooling?
I'll start with this.

And how will I find the info I need?
The build step will be Clojure and run under the JVM, the targets are all clj or cljc, so I think we are good.
I could use clj-kondo analysis data, but I don't think that is necessary.

What types of vars am I importing?

* functions - covered above.
Note that I am also importing fns from protocols.
Not sure if that complicates - think we'll be OK.
* macros - I guess I'll create a delegating macro.
* dynamic vars - I don't think I have any of these anymore, so skip for now.

I think I'll repeat, in comments, throughout the generated source that source is generated and from what template.
Just to try to avoid edits in generated source.

Generated source will be checked in like all other source.

Verification:

* run diff-apis will will save cljdoc-analyzer output to .diff-apis/.cache.
Save the .cache.
* after changes verify that cljdoc-analyzer output is same.
** we expect `:file` and `:line` meta to be different for statically imported items

And what technology will we use to rewrite Clojure source?
Well... rewrite-clj seems like a good fit.
For now, I will use master rewrite-clj to generate rewrite-clj sources from templates.
To achieve this, I'll use non generated sources only.
And I'll adapt rewrite-clj to only use non-generated sources itself.
Except for paredit, it is really a higher level API, and I don't want to uglify it by using rewrite-clj internal nses.

We can adapt if my initial solution has warts.

=== Potemkin defprotocol+
Rewrite-clj v0 used a customized version for potemkin defprotocol+.
It could be that I missed something, but I did not see how it would benefit rewrite-clj v1.
In the spirit of simplifying a cljc code-base, I turfed defprotocol+ in favour of plain old defprotocol.

We can reintroduce defprotocol+ if we learn that it does actually help with performance significantly.

=== Positional support
Rewrite-clj v0:

1. added a custom zipper to optionally track row/col within Clojure/ClojureScript/EDN files.
2. expresses positions as a `[row-number col-number]` vector.

Rewrite-cljs:

1. made use of the positional support provided by Clojure tools reader.
2. exposed a couple of functions to search by position.
3. expressed positions as a `{:row row-number :col col-number}` map

Because the positional support in rewrite-clj v0 tracks row/col even after zipper modifications, we use it in rewrite-clj v1 instead of rewrite-cljs's implementation.
We:

1. continue to support both rewrite-clj v0 vector and rewrite-cljs map notations for positions on function parameters.
2. use vector notation for position on function returns.
I personally prefer the map notation, but, as a rule, favor rewrite-clj v0 over rewrite-cljs because rewrite-clj v0 is the more widely used library and thus changes affect more users.
3. include rewrite-cljs's positional functions: `rewrite-clj.zip/find-last-by-pos` and `rewrite-clj.zip/find-tag-by-pos`.

The most glaring breaking change for ClojureScript is that it must now create the zipper with positional support enabled, for example: `(z/of-string "[1 2 3]" {:track-position? true})`
