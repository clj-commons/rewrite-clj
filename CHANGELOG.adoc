== rewrite-clj v1

For a list of breaking changes see link:#v1-breaking[breaking changes].

// Release workflow will:
// - Fail when:
//   - there is no "== Unreleased" section header
//   - or the section contains no descriptive text
// - Replace the Unreleased section header with actual release version
// - Prepend a new Unreleased section header

=== Unreleased

If you wish, you can read nitty gritty details on link:doc/design/01-merging-rewrite-clj-and-rewrite-cljs.adoc[merging rewrite clj v0 and rewrite cljs].
What follows is a summary of changes.

==== New
* A new home under clj-commons. Thanks to @xsc, rewrite-clj will also retain its same maven coordinates on clojars making for a seamless upgrade path for rewrite-clj v0 users.
* Now supports ClojureScript, merging in rewrite-cljs specific functionality.
Frustrations like not having namespace map support and differences from rewrite-clj, like whitespace parsing, should now be things of the past.
Rewrite-cljs users migrating to rewrite-clj v1 are now at, and will remain at, feature parity with rewrite-clj.
* Additions to the public API:
** `rewrite-clj.paredit` - carried over from rewrite-cljs, an API for structured editing of Clojure forms
** `rewrite-clj.zip`
*** Exposes the following (accidentally?) omitted functions:
**** `append-child*`
**** `insert-newline-left`
**** `insert-newline-right`
**** `insert-space-left`
**** `insert-space-right`
**** `subzip`
*** Adds functions from rewrite-cljs
**** `find-last-by-pos` - navigate to node at row/col
**** `find-tag-by-pos` - navigate to node with tag at row/col
**** `position-span` - returns start and end row/col for a form
**** `remove-preserve-newline` - same as remove but preserves newlines
*** Adds namespaced element support functions
**** `reapply-context` - reapplies (or removes) map qualifier node context from keywords and symbols
**** zipper creation functions now optionally accept an auto-resolve function to support sexpr on namespaced element nodes
*** Other additions
**** `sexpr-able?` - return true if `sexpr` is supported for current node
** `rewrite-clj.node`
*** Additions:
**** `keyword-node?` - returns true if form is a rewrite-clj keyword node
**** `map-qualifier-node` - to create a namespaced map's map qualifier node manually
**** `map-context-apply` - apply map qualifier to keyword or symbol
**** `map-context-clear` - remove map qualifier from keyword or symbol
**** `node?` - returns true if a form is a rewrite-clj created node
**** `sexpr-able?` - return true if `sexpr` is supported for node
**** `symbol-node?` - return true if node is a rewrite-clj symbol node
*** Updates:
**** `sexpr`, `sepxrs` and `child-sexprs` - now optionally take an options argument to specify an auto-resolve function
* Many updates to docs and docstrings

==== Fixes
* OS specific end of line variants in source now normalized consistently to `\newline` https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/93[#93]
* Postwalk on larger source file no longer throws StackOverflow https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/69[#69]
* Postwalk now walks in post order https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/123[#123]
* We now preserve newline at end of file https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/121[#121]
* Support for garden style selectors https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/92[#92]
* Correct and document prefix and suffix functions https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/91[#91]
* Positional metadata added by the reader is elided on coercion https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/90[#90]
* Can now read `\\##Inf`, `##-Inf` and `##Nan` https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/75[#75]
* Ensure that all rewrite-clj nodes coerce to themselves
* Strings now coerce to string nodes (instead of to token nodes) https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/126[#126]
* Regexes now coerce to regex nodes https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/128[#128]
* Regex node now:
** converts correctly to string https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/127[#127]
** reports correct length https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/130[#130]
* Moved from potemkin import-vars to static template based version https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/98[#98]:
** Avoids frustration/mysteries of dynamic import-vars for users and maintainers
** Argument names now correct in API docs (some were gensymed previously)
** Line numbers for protocols in API docs are now correct
** Also turfed use of custom version of potemkin defprotocol+ in favor of plain old defprotocol. Perhaps I missed something, but I did not see the benefit of defprotocol+ for rewrite-clj v1.

==== Internal changes (developer facing)
* Tests updated to hit public APIs https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/106[#106]
* ClojureScript tests, in addition to being run under node, are now also run under chrome-headless, shadow-cljs, and for self-hosted ClojureScript, under planck.
* Now testing rewrite-clj compiled under GraalVM native-image in two variants:
** In a pure form where library and tests are compiled
** Via sci where a sci exposed rewrite-clj is compiled, then tests are interpreted.
* Now automatically testing rewrite-clj against popular libs https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/124[#124]
* Now linting source with clj-kondo, added some custom hooks for our variations on import-vars
* Code coverage reports now generated for Clojure unit test run and sent to codecov.io
* Can now preview for cljdoc locally via `script/cljdoc_preview.clj`
* API diffs for rewrite-clj v1 vs rewrite-clj v0 vs rewrite-cljs can be generated by `script/gen_api_diffs.clj`
* Contributors are acknowledged in README and updated via `script/update_readme.clj`
* Doc code blocks are automatically tested via `script/doc_tests.clj` https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/100[#100]
* Some tooling and tech replaced:
** All scripts are written in Clojure and run via Babashka or Clojure.
** Switched from leiningen `project.clj` to Clojure tools CLI `deps.edn`
** Moved from CommonMark to AsciiDoc for docs
** Moved from publishing docs locally via codox to publishing to cljdoc
** Now using CommonMark in docstrings (they render nicely in cljdoc)
** Moved from TravisCI to GitHub Actions where, in addition to Linux, we also test under macOS and Windows
** Adopted kaocha for Clojure testing, stuck with doo for regular ClojureScript testing, and added support for ClojureScript watch testing with figwheel main.
** Potemkin dynamic import-vars replaced with static code generation solution
* Added GitHub issue templates
* Fixed a generative test sporadic failure https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/88[#88]

[#v1-breaking]
=== v1 Breaking Changes

// Release workflow will:
// - If an "=== Unreleased Breaking Changes" section header exists here:
//   - Fail when the section contains no descriptive text
//   - Else replace the Unreleased Breaking Changes section header with actual release version
// If you have no breaking changes, don't include an Unreleased Breaking Changes header

==== Unreleased Breaking Changes

* Minimum Clojure version bumped from v1.5.1 to v1.9
* Minimum ClojureScript version (from whatever is was for rewrite-cljs) bumped to v1.10
* Minimum Java version bumped from v7 to v8
* Keyword node field `namespaced?` renamed to `auto-resolved?`
* Now using `ex-info` for explicitly raised exceptions
* Rewrite-cljs positional support migrated to rewrite-clj's positional support
* Namespaced element support reworked
** Namespace map prefix, is now stored in a namespaced map qualifier node.
Prior to v1, was stored as a keyword.
** Namespaced element sexpr support now relies on user specifiable auto-resolve function to resolve qualifiers
** Unlike rewrite-clj v0, the default auto-resolve behaviour never consults `\*ns*`
** An sexpr for keyword node `::alias/foo` no longer returns `:alias/foo` (this could be considered a bug fix, but if your code is expecting this, then you'll need to make changes)
** The following namespaced element `sexpr` examples assume:
*** `\*ns*` is bound to `user` namespace (important only for rewrite-clj v0):
*** We are using the default auto-resolve function for rewrite-clj v1
*** That you will refer to the link:01-user-guide.adoc#namespaced-elements[User Guide] for more detailed examples of v1 behaviour

|===
* Potentially breaking
** Switched to `clojure.tools.reader.edn`
** Some rewrite-cljs optimizations were dropped in favor of a single code base
** Deleted unused `rewrite-clj.node.indent` https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/116[#116]
** Deleted redundent `rewrite-clj.parser.util` as part of https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/93[#93].
If you were using this internal namespace you can opt to switch to, the also internal, `rewrite-clj.reader` namespace.
