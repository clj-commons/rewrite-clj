(defn prewalk
  "Return zipper modified by an isolated depth-first pre-order traversal.

   Pre-order traversal visits root before children.
   For example, traversal order of `(1 (2 3 (4 5) 6 (7 8)) 9)` is:

   1. `(1 (2 3 (4 5) 6 (7 8)) 9)`
   2. `1`
   3. `(2 3 (4 5) 6 (7 8))`
   4. `2`
   5. `3`
   6. `(4 5)`
   7. `4`
   8. `5`
   9. `6`
   10. `(7 8)`
   11. `7`
   12. `8`
   13. `9`

   Traversal starts at the current node in `zloc` and continues to the end of the isolated sub-tree.

   Function `f` is called on the zipper locations satisfying predicate `p?` and must return either
   - nil to indicate no changes
   - or a valid zipper
   WARNING: when function `f` changes the location in the zipper, normal traversal will be affected.

   When `p?` is not specified `f` is called on all locations.

   To walk all nodes, you'll want to walk from the root node.
   You can do this by, for example, using [[of-string*]] instead of [[of-string]].
