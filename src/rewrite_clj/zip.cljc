  "A rich API for navigating and updating Clojure/ClojureScripti/EDN source code via a zipper tree.

  The zipper holds a tree of nodes representing source code. It also holds your current location while navigating
  through the tree and any pending changes you have made. Changes are applied back into the tree
  when invoking root functions.

  Although they are preserved, whitespace and comment nodes are normally skipped when navigating through the tree.
  There are times when you will want to include whitespace and comment nodes, and as you see below, provisions are
  available to do so.

  It is good to remember that while some function names convey mutation, we are never changing anything, we are
  instead returning modified copies.

  Some conventions in the code and docstrings:
  - `zloc` is the used as the argument name for our zipper
  - \"current node in `zloc`\" is shorthand for: node at current location in zipper `zloc`

  Because this API contains many functions, we offer the following categorized listing:

  **Create a zipper**
  [[edn]]
  [[edn*]]
  [[of-string]]
  [[of-file]]

  **Move**
  [[left]]
  [[right]]
  [[up]]
  [[down]]
  [[prev]]
  [[next]]
  [[leftmost]]
  [[rightmost]]

  **Move without skipping whitespace and comments**
  [[left*]]
  [[right*]]
  [[up*]]
  [[down*]]
  [[prev*]]
  [[next*]]
  [[leftmost*]]
  [[rightmost*]]

  **Whitespace/comment aware skip**
  [[skip]]
  [[skip-whitespace]]
  [[skip-whitespace-left]]

  **Test for whitespace**
  [[whitespace?]]

  [[whitespace-or-comment?]]

  **Test location**

  [[end?]]

  **Test data type**
