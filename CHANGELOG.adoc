=== Unreleased

* Clojure string to rewrite-clj node coercion fixes
https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/214[#214]
(@borkdude/@lread collab)
** `"a\n\b\r\nc"` is now preserved as is.
It was being coerced to:
+
[source,clojure]
----
"a
b
c"
----
** escaped characters now coerce correctly.
Previously we were only handling `\"`.
Strings like `"\\s+"` now handled and preserved.

=== v1.1.46

* added new `rewrite-clj.zip` functions `of-string*` and `of-file*`, these are versions of `of-string` and `of-file` that do no auto-navigation
https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/189[#189]
(thanks @mainej for the analysis work)
* a lazy sequence now coerces to a rewrite-clj list node https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/pull/180[#180] (thanks @borkdude!)
* exceptions thrown while reading now include `:row` and `:col` keys in `ex-data` https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/pull/181[#181] (thanks @ferdinand-beyer)
* docs
** a docstring typo fix https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/pull/191[#191] (thanks @BTowersCoding!)
* Implement equality for seq nodes https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/212[#212] (@borkdude)

=== v1.0.572-alpha

If you wish, you can read nitty gritty details on link:doc/design/01-merging-rewrite-clj-and-rewrite-cljs.adoc[merging rewrite clj v0 and rewrite cljs].
What follows is a summary of changes.

https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/compare/v0.6.1\...v1.0.572-alpha[Gritty details of changes for this release]

==== New
* A new home under clj-commons.
Thanks to @xsc, rewrite-clj will also retain its same maven coordinates on Clojars making for a seamless upgrade path for rewrite-clj v0 users.
* Now supports ClojureScript, merging in rewrite-cljs specific functionality.
Frustrations like not having namespace map support and differences from rewrite-clj, like whitespace parsing, should now be things of the past.
Rewrite-cljs users migrating to rewrite-clj v1 are now at, and will remain at, feature parity with rewrite-clj.
* Additions to the public API:
** `rewrite-clj.paredit` - carried over from rewrite-cljs, an API for structured editing of Clojure forms
** `rewrite-clj.zip`
*** Exposes the following (accidentally?) omitted functions:
**** `append-child*`
**** `insert-newline-left`
**** `insert-newline-right`
**** `insert-space-left`
**** `insert-space-right`
**** `subzip`
*** Adds functions from rewrite-cljs
**** `find-last-by-pos` - navigate to node at row/col
**** `find-tag-by-pos` - navigate to node with tag at row/col
**** `position-span` - returns start and end row/col for a form
**** `remove-preserve-newline` - same as remove but preserves newlines
*** Adds namespaced element support functions
**** `reapply-context` - reapplies (or removes) map qualifier node context from keywords and symbols
**** zipper creation functions now optionally accept an auto-resolve function to support sexpr on namespaced element nodes
*** Other additions
**** `sexpr-able?` - return true if `sexpr` is supported for current node
** `rewrite-clj.node`
*** Additions:
**** `keyword-node?` - returns true if form is a rewrite-clj keyword node
**** `map-qualifier-node` - to create a namespaced map's map qualifier node manually
**** `map-context-apply` - apply map qualifier to keyword or symbol
**** `map-context-clear` - remove map qualifier from keyword or symbol
**** `node?` - returns true if a form is a rewrite-clj created node
**** `sexpr-able?` - return true if `sexpr` is supported for node
**** `symbol-node?` - return true if node is a rewrite-clj symbol node
*** Updates:
**** `sexpr`, `sepxrs` and `child-sexprs` - now optionally take an options argument to specify an auto-resolve function
* Many updates to docs and docstrings

==== Fixes
* OS specific end of line variants in source now normalized consistently to `\newline` https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/93[#93]
* Postwalk on larger source file no longer throws StackOverflow https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/69[#69]
* Postwalk now walks in post order https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/123[#123]
* We now preserve newline at end of file https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/121[#121]
* Support for garden style selectors https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/92[#92]
* Correct and document prefix and suffix functions https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/91[#91]
* Positional metadata added by the reader is elided on coercion https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/90[#90]
* Can now read `\\##Inf`, `##-Inf` and `##Nan` https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/75[#75]
* Ensure that all rewrite-clj nodes coerce to themselves
* Strings now coerce to string nodes (instead of to token nodes) https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/126[#126]
* Regexes now coerce to regex nodes https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/128[#128]
* Regex node now:
** converts correctly to string https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/127[#127]
** reports correct length https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/130[#130]
* Moved from potemkin import-vars to static template based version https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/98[#98]:
** Avoids frustration/mysteries of dynamic import-vars for users and maintainers
** Argument names now correct in API docs (some were gensymed previously)
** Also turfed use of custom version of potemkin defprotocol+ in favor of plain old defprotocol.
Perhaps I missed something, but I did not see the benefit of defprotocol+ for rewrite-clj v1.

==== Internal changes (developer facing)
* Tests updated to hit public APIs https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/106[#106]
* ClojureScript tests, in addition to being run under node, are now also run under chrome-headless, shadow-cljs, and for self-hosted ClojureScript, under planck.
* Now testing rewrite-clj compiled under GraalVM native-image in two variants:
** In a pure form where library and tests are compiled
** Via sci where a sci exposed rewrite-clj is compiled, then tests are interpreted.
* Now automatically testing rewrite-clj against popular libs https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/124[#124]
* Now linting source with clj-kondo
* Code coverage reports now generated for Clojure unit test run and sent to codecov.io
* Can now preview for cljdoc locally via `script/cljdoc_preview.clj`
* API diffs for rewrite-clj v1 vs rewrite-clj v0 vs rewrite-cljs can be generated by `script/gen_api_diffs.clj`
* Contributors are acknowledged in README and updated via `script/update_readme.clj`
* Doc code blocks are automatically tested via `script/doc_tests.clj` https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/100[#100]
* Some tooling and tech replaced:
** All scripts are written in Clojure and run via Babashka or Clojure.
** Switched from leiningen `project.clj` to Clojure tools CLI `deps.edn`
** Moved from CommonMark to AsciiDoc for docs
** Moved from publishing docs locally via codox to publishing to cljdoc
** Now using CommonMark in docstrings (they render nicely in cljdoc)
** Moved from TravisCI to GitHub Actions where, in addition to Linux, we also test under macOS and Windows
** Adopted kaocha for Clojure testing, stuck with doo for regular ClojureScript testing, and added support for ClojureScript watch testing with figwheel main.
** Potemkin dynamic import-vars replaced with static code generation solution
* Added GitHub issue templates
* Fixed a generative test sporadic failure https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/88[#88]

[#v1-breaking]
=== v1 Breaking Changes

// Release workflow will:
// - If an "=== Unreleased Breaking Changes" section header exists here:
//   - Fail when the section contains no descriptive text
//   - Else replace the Unreleased Breaking Changes section header with actual release version
// If you have no breaking changes, don't include an Unreleased Breaking Changes header

==== v1.0.572-alpha

* Minimum Clojure version bumped from v1.5.1 to v1.9
* Minimum ClojureScript version (from whatever is was for rewrite-cljs) bumped to v1.10
* Minimum Java version bumped from v7 to v8
* Keyword node field `namespaced?` renamed to `auto-resolved?`
* Now using `ex-info` for explicitly raised exceptions
* Rewrite-cljs positional support migrated to rewrite-clj's positional support
* Namespaced element support reworked
** v1 changes do not affect node traversal of the namespaced map, number and order of children remain the same.
** Namespace map prefix, is now stored in a namespaced map qualifier node.
*** Prior to v1, the prefix was parsed to a keyword-node.
*** Let's look at what interesting node API functions will return for the prefix node in the following namespaced maps.
Assume we have parsed the example and traversed down to the prefix node. +
For example via: `(-> "#:prefix{:a 1}" z/of-string z/down z/node)`. +
+
|===
| node API call | rewrite-clj | `#:prefix{:a 1}` |  `#::alias{:a 1}` | `#::{:a 1}`

.2+| `string` +
is unchanged
| v1
.2+| `":prefix"`
.2+| `"::alias"`
| `"::"`
| v0
a| * throws on parse

.2+| `tag` +
is different

| v1
3+| `:map-qualifier`

| v0
2+| `:token`
a| * throws on parse

.2+| `inner?` +
still indicates that the node is a leaf node and has no children

| v1
3+| `false`
| v0
2+| `false`
a| * throws on parse

| `sexpr`
4+| <read on below for discussion on sexpr>

|===
** Namespaced element `sexpr` support now relies on user specifiable auto-resolve function to resolve qualifiers
*** Unlike rewrite-clj v0, the default auto-resolve behaviour never consults `\*ns*`
*** An sexpr for keyword node `::alias/foo` no longer returns `:alias/foo` (this could be considered a bug fix, but if your code is expecting this, then you'll need to make changes)
** The following namespaced element `sexpr` examples assume:
*** `\*ns*` is bound to `user` namespace (important only for rewrite-clj v0):
*** We are using the default auto-resolve function for rewrite-clj v1
*** That you will refer to the link:doc/01-user-guide.adoc#namespaced-elements[User Guide] for more detailed examples of v1 behaviour

|===
* Potentially breaking
** Some http://rundis.github.io/blog/2015/clojurescript_performance_tuning.html[rewrite-cljs optimizations] were dropped in favor of a single code base.
If performance for rewrite-clj v1 for ClojureScript users is poor with today's ClojureScript, we shall adapt.
** Deleted unused `rewrite-clj.node.indent` https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/116[#116]
** Deleted redundant `rewrite-clj.parser.util` as part of https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/93[#93].
If you were using this internal namespace you can opt to switch to, the also internal, `rewrite-clj.reader` namespace.
