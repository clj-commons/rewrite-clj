  "This is the underlying zipper that rewrite-clj uses.

   It delegates to two different zipper implementations:
   1. the code herein under defn-switchable bodies when the user has created a `:track-position?` zipper
   2. otherwise clojure.zip, with some small exceptions:
      - `edit` explicitly handles the delegation - I assume because defn-switchable could not handle the argument delegation
      - there are fns exclusive to the position trakcing zipper, `position`, `position-span`"
