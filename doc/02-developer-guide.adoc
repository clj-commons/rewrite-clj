== Supported Environments
Rewrite-clj is verified on each push on macOS, Ubuntu and Windows via GitHub Actions.

All scripts are written in Clojure and most invoked via https://github.com/borkdude/babashka[babashka] tasks.
This gives us a cross platform scripting language that is familiar, fun and consistent.

We make use of planck for cljs bootstrap (aka cljs self-hosted) testing.
Planck is currently not available for Windows.

We test that rewrite-clj operates as expected when natively compile via GraalVM.
Automated testing is setup using GraalVM JDK 17 and JDK 20.
At this time we only test against the Community Edition.

== Prerequisites
* Java JDK 1.8 or above (shadow-cljs tests require min of JDK 11)
* NodeJs v12 or above
* Clojure v1.10.1.697 or above for `clojure` command
** Note that rewrite-clj v1 itself supports Clojure v1.8 and above
* Babashka v0.3.7 or above
* Current release of GraalVM JDK 17 or 20, if you want to run GraalVM native image tests

=== Windows Notes

==== Git and newlines
The primary development OSes for rewrite-clj are macOS and Linux.
Our line endings are LF only.

I'm not sure what Windows developers typically want for line endings while working on source.
I expect, but don't know, that most Windows editors automatically handle LF as line ending.
Someone let me know if I am wrong.

Note that I do explicitly set git's config `core.autocrlf` to `false` on our Windows CI unit test environment.
Our import vars code generation checks currently rely on line endings remaining unconverted.

==== Babashka
The Clojure story on Windows is still in the early chapters.
https://scoop.sh/[Scoop] offers an easy way to install tools.
@littleli is doing a great job  w/maintaining https://github.com/littleli/scoop-clojure[scoop apps for Clojure, Babashka and other tools] and this is how I installed Babashka.

==== Clojure
We all choose our own paths, but for me, using https://github.com/borkdude/deps.clj[deps.clj] instead of https://github.com/clojure/tools.deps.alpha/wiki/clj-on-Windows[Clojure's PowerShell Module] offered me no fuss no muss Clojure on Windows and GitHub Actions on Windows.
I decided to install deps.clj not through scoop but through https://github.com/borkdude/deps.clj#windows[the deps.clj `install.ps1` script].
This makes it simple to treat `deps.exe` as if it were the official `clojure` via a simple rename:

----
Rename-Item $HOME\deps.clj\deps.exe clojure.exe
----

==== GraalVM
You'll have your own preference, but I find it convenient to install GraalVM on Windows via scoop.

You'll need to load the appropriate Visual C++ environment variables for GraalVM's native-image to do its work.
I found it oddly cumbersome to load them from PowerShell, so I work from a cmd shell instead.
Here's what works on my Windows dev environment:

[source,shell]
----
call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"
----

== Setup
After checking out this project from GitHub,

1. Install JavaScript libraries and tools required by https://github.com/bensu/doo[doo] and https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs[shadow-cljs]:
+
----
npm ci
----

2. If you are on macOS or linux, https://github.com/planck-repl/planck#installing[install planck].

3. Initialize cache for clj-kondo so it can lint against your dependencies
+
----
bb lint
----

== Babashka Tasks

We make use of babashka tasks for development related commands.

To see all available tasks with a short description run:
----
bb tasks
----

To run a task, for example, the `lint` task:
----
bb lint
----

Usage help for a task is requested via `--help`, for example:
----
bb lint --help
----

Tasks are described throughout this document.

== Code Generation
Rewrite-clj v0 used a version of potemkin import-vars.
Potemkin import-vars copies specified vars from a specified namespace to the current namespace at load time.
Due to often mysterious issues related to import-vars, a general dislike for import-vars in the Clojure community, and associated maintenance costs, we've opted to instead generate code for rewrite-clj v1.

For any source that used potemkin import-vars, we now have a separate template clj (or cljc) file.
For example `src/rewrite_clj/zip.cljc` is generated by template `template/rewrite_clj/zip.cljc`.

The syntax of import-vars in the template remains familiar.
The following old potemkin import-vars syntax:

//:test-doc-blocks/skip
[source,clojure]
----
(import-vars
  [[my.ns1 my-var1 my-var2 my-var3]
   [my.ns2 my-var4 my-var5]])
----

Is expressed in our templates as:

//:test-doc-blocks/skip
[source,clojure]
----
#_{:import-vars/import
   {:from [[my.ns1 my-var1 my-var2 my-var3]
           [my.ns2 my-var4 my-var5]]}}
----

Any `:added` and `:deprecated` metadata should be defined in the template and not on the reference var.
This keeps the metadata on the public API vars only and avoids having the ClojureScript compiler warn about deprecated calls on internal sources within rewrite-clj:

//:test-doc-blocks/skip
[source,clojure]
----
#_{:import-vars/import
   {:from [[my.ns1
            ^{:deprecated "1.2.3"} obsolete-fn
            ^{:added "1.2.4"} new-fn]]}}
----

We also carry over rewrite-cljc support for `:import-vars/import-with-mods`, via an optional `:opts`.
See `template/rewrite_clj/zip.cljc` for example usage.

Importing will generate delegates.
An import of `(defn foo [a b] (+ a b))` from namespace `my.ns1` will generate `(defn foo [a b] (my.ns1/foo a b))`.
No generation of requires is done, your template will have to require `my.ns1` in normal Clojure code.

At this time, we don't handle destructuring in arglists, and will throw unless args are all symbols.

To generate target source from templates run:
[source,shell]
----
bb apply-import-vars gen-code
----
You are expected to review the generated changes and commit the generated source to version control.
We don't link:#linting[lint] templates, but we do lint the generated code.

To perform a read-only check, run:
[source,shell]
----
bb apply-import-vars check
----
The check command will exit with 0 if no changes are required, otherwise it will exit with 1.
Our build script will run the check command and fail the build if there are any pending changes that have not been applied.

== Testing During Development
Your personal preference will likely be different, but during maintenance and refactoring, I found running tests continuously for Clojure and ClojureScript helpful.

=== Clojure
For Clojure, I open a shell terminal window and run:

----
bb test-clj-watch
----

This launches https://github.com/lambdaisland/kaocha[kaocha] in watch mode.

=== ClojureScript
For ClojureScript, I open a shell terminal window and run:

----
bb test-cljs-watch
----

This launches https://figwheel.org/[fighweel main].
After initialization, your default web browser will automatically be opened with the figwheel auto-testing page.

== Docs

All documentation is written in AsciiDoc.
We follow https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-recommended-practices/#one-sentence-per-line[AsciiDoc best practice of one sentence per line].

Images are created and edited with https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases[draw.io desktop].
We export to .png with a border of 10 and a transparent background.
At the time of this writing draw.io does not remember export settings, so you'll have to enter them in each time.

== Testing Doc Code Blocks
We use https://github.com/lread/test-doc-blocks[test-doc-blocks] to verify that code blocks in our documentation are in good working order.

----
bb test-doc
----

This generates tests for doc code blocks and then runs them under Clojure and ClojureScript.

== Testing Before a Push
Before pushing, you likely want to mimic what is run on each push via GitHub Actions.

=== Unit tests
Unit tests can be run locally on your dev box.
Some tests require a specific os and jdk, you will see warnings if a test is skipped for your current environment.
----
bb ci-unit-tests
----

Unit tests for our ci matrix are driven by:
----
bb script/ci_unit_tests.clj matrix-for-ci --format=json
----

To get a human readable version of the ci matrix:
----
bb ci-unit-tests matrix-for-ci
----

=== Native image tests
We also verify that rewrite-clj functions as expected when compiled via Graal's `native-image`.

1. Tests and library natively compiled:
+
----
bb test-native
----
2. Library natively compiled and tests interpreted via sci
+
----
bb test-native-sci
----

[#libs-test]
=== Libs test
To try to ensure our changes to rewrite-clj do not inadvertently break existing popular libraries, we run their tests, or a portion thereof, against rewrite-clj.
----
bb test-libs run
----

See link:../README.adoc#used-in[README] for current libs we test against.

Additional libs are welcome.

To see a list of available libs we currently test against:
----
bb test-libs list
----

If you are troubleshooting locally, and want to only run specific tests, you can specify which ones you'd like to run.
For example:

----
bb test-libs run cljfmt zprint
----

Updating the test-libs script to run against current versions of libs is recommended, but care must be taken when updating.
We want to make sure we are patching correctly to use rewrite-clj v1 and running a lib's tests as intended.

To check for outdated libs:

----
bb test-libs outdated
----

Notes:

* The `test-libs` task was developed on macOS and is run on CI under Linux only under JDK 11 only.
We can expand variations at some later date if there is any value to it.
* We test the current HEAD of rewrite-clj v1 against specific versions (latest at the time of this writing) of libs.
* We patch lib deps and sometimes code (ex. `require` for `rewrite-cljc` becomes `rewrite-clj`).
* As folks migrate to rewrite-clj v1, the need for current patches will lessen.
* Updating what versions we test against is currently a manual, but not an overly burdensome, task.

== Checking for Outdated Dependencies

To see what new dependencies are available, run:
----
bb outdated
----

This task uses:

* https://github.com/liquidz/antq[antq] for Clojure.
* npm for JavaScript.
It only checks against installed `./node_modules`, so you may want to run `npm ci` first.

To bump JavaScript npm packages:

. make appropriate changes to `package.json`
. delete the `./node_modules` directory and `./package-lock.json`
. run `npm install`
. after you are happy the updates work, commit both `package.json` and `package-lock.json`

[#linting]
== Linting
We use https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo[clj-kondo] and https://github.com/jonase/eastwood[eastwood] to lint rewrite-clj source code.

We fail the build on any lint violations.
The CI server runs:
----
bb lint
----
and you can too. The lint script will build the clj-kondo cache when it is missing or stale.
If you want to force a rebuild of the cache run:
----
bb lint --rebuild
----

https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo/blob/master/doc/editor-integration.md[Integrate clj-kondo into your editor] to catch mistakes as they happen.

You can optionally:

* `bb -lint-kondo` to run only clj-kondo linting
* `bb -lint-eastwood` to run only the eastwood linting

== API diffs
Rewrite-clj v1's primary goals include remaining compatible with rewrite-clj v0 and rewrite-cljs and avoiding breaking changes.

To generate reports on differences between rewrite-clj v0, rewrite-cljs and
rewrite-clj v1 APIs, run:

----
bb doc-api-diffs
----

WARNING: This task currently needs love, see https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/issues/132[#132].

Run this script manually on an as-needed basis, and certainly before any official release.
Generated reports are to be checked in to version control.

Reports are generated to `doc/generated/api-diffs/` and include manually written notes from `doc/diff-notes/`.

These reports are referenced from other docs, so if you rename files, be sure to search for links.

Makes use of https://github.com/lread/diff-apis[diff-apis].
Delete `.diff-apis/.cache` if you need a clean run.


== Cljdoc Preview
Before a release, it can be comforting to preview what docs will look like on https://cljdoc.org/[cljdoc].

Limitations

* This task should be considered experimental, I have only tested running on macOS, but am fairly confident it will work on Linux.
Not sure about Windows at this time.
* You have to push your changes to GitHub to preview them.
This allows for a full preview that includes any links (source, images, etc) to GitHub.
This works fine from branches and forks - in case you don't want to affect your main development branch for a preview.

**Start Local Services**

To start the local cljdoc docker container:
----
bb cljdoc-preview start
----

The local cljdoc server allows your ingested docs to be viewed in your web browser.

The start command also automatically checks docker hub for any updates so that our cljdoc preview matches the current production version of cljdoc.

**Ingest Docs**

To ingest rewrite-clj API and docs into the local cljdoc database:
----
bb cljdoc-preview ingest
----

The ingest command automatically publishes rewrite-clj to your local maven repository (cljdoc only works with published jars).

The locally published version will include a `-cljdoc-preview` suffix.
I find this distinction helps to reduce confusion around locally vs remotely installed artifacts.

You'll have to remember to git commit and git push your changes before ingesting.

Repeat these steps any time you want to preview changes.

**Preview Docs**

To open a view to the ingested docs in your default web browser:
----
bb cljdoc-preview view
----

If you have just run the start command, be a bit patient, the cljdoc server can take a few moments to start up - especially on macOS due to poor file sharing performance.

**Stop Local Services**

When you are done, you'll want to stop your docker container:
----
bb cljdoc-preview stop
----

This will also delete temporary files created to support your preview session, most notably the local cljdoc database.

Note that NO cleanup is done for any rewrite-clj artifacts published to your local maven repository.

**Container Status**

If you forget where you are at with your docker containers, run:
----
bb cljdoc-preview status
----

== Code Coverage

We use https://github.com/cloverage/cloverage[cloverage] via https://github.com/lambdaisland/kaocha[kaocha] to generate code coverage reports via:
----
bb test-coverage
----

Our CI service is setup to automatically generate then upload reports to https://codecov.io[CodeCov].

We have no specific goals for code coverage, but new code is generally expected to have tests.

So why measure coverage? It simply offers us some idea of what code our test suite hits.

== Contributors
We honor current and past contributors to rewrite-clj in our README file.

To update contributors, update `doc/contributors.edn` then run:

----
bb doc-update-readme
----
